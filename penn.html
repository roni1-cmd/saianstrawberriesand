<p class="visible-line">There's nothing here. I also advice you to at least lower your phone's volume. Baka sobrang lakas e.</p>
<p class="visible-line">Your love love,</p>
<p class="visible-line">Penn/Jamm</p>

<div class="hidden-letter" id="secret">
  <p>Just kidding, baby. Of course may laman ’to, hindi naman ako gagawa ng ganito kung wala lang. This is simple, a little messy, and very me, but it’s honest. This is just my little way of appreciating you when words and gestures don’t feel enough anymore.</p> <p>Though kailangan pa talaga siyang i-solve, unorthodox? Maybe. But that’s exactly why I chose this, because loving you never felt like something I wanted to do in a normal way. I like creating things that take effort, time, and thought. Stuff you don’t just skim through or forget after a few seconds. Something you actually experience instead of just seeing.</p> <p>You know what, love? There’s so much I want to tell you, sobra, to the point na nahihirapan na akong piliin kung saan magsisimula. Even this site feels too small for everything I’m carrying inside. There are thoughts I keep at night, moments I replay, and feelings I don’t always know how to explain properly. I don’t want to rush them or force them into one place.</p> <p>So I decided to make this into parts, slowly, one piece at a time. Different forms, different moods, depending on what I want to tell you at that moment. Who knows what comes next, right? Maybe something simpler, maybe something even more complicated. But one thing stays the same, bawat part nito is for you, always you.</p> <p>And honestly, baby, this isn’t about being impressive or clever. I don’t care if it looks perfect or polished. What matters to me is that it feels real when you read it. That you can feel me behind the screen, thinking about you while making this. Because every detail here exists for a reason, even the imperfect ones.</p> <p>I know I’m not always good at saying everything out loud. Sometimes I joke too much, sometimes I dodge the serious parts. But this is me trying in my own way. This is me choosing effort instead of silence. Choosing to show you what I feel instead of assuming you already know.</p> <p>So if you’re reading this slowly, take your time. There’s no rush, no deadline, no right way to go through it. Just know that at the moment this was made, you were on my mind. You mattered enough for me to sit down and build something instead of doing nothing. And that alone should tell you a lot.</p>
